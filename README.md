RDuD2
=====

This project covers my adventures with a Raspberry Pi / Arduino controlled robot.

This project allows Python (and thus Raspberry Pi users) to write Python code for Arduino and the Robotbits Arduino RobotShield.

The code supplied works best with a Frindo robot platform using three Sharp sensors, but can be applied to any robot project.

See the motorfuncs and sensorfuncs files for details on the example set-up. 

The original RobotShield Arduino library was written by Jonathan Luke of [RobotBits.co.uk](www.robotbits.co.uk) and was released into the public domain.


Usage
=====

My project uses:

[Nanpy](https://github.com/russb78/nanpy), an Arduino Firmata project (and is a strict requirement).

A Raspberry Pi with Raspbian installed.

A [frindo.org](http://frindo.org) robot platform (inc. Arduino and sensors)
