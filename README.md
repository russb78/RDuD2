RDuD2
=====

This project covers my adventures with a Raspberry Pi / Arduino controlled robot.

This project allows Python (and Raspberry Pi users) to write Python code for the Robotbits.co.uk Arduino RobotShield.
The code supplied works best with a frindo.org robot platform using three Sharp sensors. 
See the motorfuncs and sensorfuncs files for details on the example set-up. 

Usage
=====

This project uses:
Nanpy, an Arduino Firmata project and is a strict requirement.
A Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 
A frindo.org robot platform (inc. Arduino and sensors)
